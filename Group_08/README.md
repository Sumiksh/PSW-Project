## Project Description
PSW Support is dedicated to creating a reliable and user-friendly online platform that serves two primary groups: individuals and families in need of personal care assistance, and Personal Support Workers (PSWs) seeking dependable employment. Our mission is to simplify the process of connecting clients with verified PSWs, ensuring that those requiring professional personal support – such as the elderly, people with disabilities, or anyone in need of personal care – can easily find and receive the highest quality of care from our trusted and thoroughly vetted PSWs. At the same time, we are committed to providing PSWs with stable and rewarding job opportunities, acknowledging the invaluable service they provide in the realm of personal support and care. By focusing on these dual objectives, PSW Support aims to enhance the lives of both clients and care providers through a seamless, secure, and beneficial online service.

## Tech Stack
### Back-end
On beackend we are using Node.js becuase it allows for building fast and scalable network applications. Its non-blocking, event-driven architecture makes it efficient and suitable for real-time applications. 
Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web applications.
### Front-end
Next.js, a React-based framework, is an eminent choice for developing web applications, thanks to its comprehensive feature set and developer-friendly attributes. This framework stands out for its integrated support for routing, data-fetching, and data-rendering, streamlining the development process significantly.

Key features of Next.js include:  
- Efficient Routing Mechanism: Next.js offers a built-in routing system that simplifies the process of setting up and managing page navigation within web applications.  
- Seamless Data-Fetching and Rendering: The framework provides robust tools for data management, enabling efficient data-fetching and rendering practices that enhance the user experience.  
- Fast Refresh Capability: Next.js incorporates a 'fast refresh' feature, ensuring a swift and seamless development experience by instantly reflecting code changes in the browser, without losing component state.  
- Optimized Image Component: The framework includes an optimized Image component, designed to automatically adjust images for various screen sizes, improving performance and loading times across different devices.  
- Comprehensive Library Support: Next.js comes equipped with extensive library support, including utilities for implementing cards, rows, columns, and full compatibility with Bootstrap. This extensive library support facilitates a wide range of design and layout possibilities, making it easier for developers to create visually appealing and responsive web interfaces.
